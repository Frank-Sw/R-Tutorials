[html version with unfolded code chunks](https://rawgit.com/Z3tt/ggplot2-tutorial/master/ggplot2-tutorial_unfolded.html)

Large parts of this tutorial follow a [blog entry](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) called **Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet** by zev@zevross.com, posted on 4. August 2014.
Most changes were made to follow the [R style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), to change style and aesthetics of plots to be (more) beautiful and meaningful as well as to include additional tipps. Beside that, data import and setup was modified to RDS.
