The initial version of this tutorial follows a blog entry called [**Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet**](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/) by zev@zevross.com, posted on 4. August 2014, updated last in January 2016.

Major changes were made:
* to follow the R style guide (e.g. [Hadley's](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html), [Google's](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) or [Coding Club's](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/04/25/etiquette.html#syntax) style guides),
* to change style and aesthetics of plots (e.g. axis titles, legends and nice colors for all plots not only some),
* to have a updated version which keeps track of changes in `ggplot2`,
* to modify data import and setup to RDS,
* to have an executable R script for exercises and workshops,
* to include additional tipps on e.g:
    + other plot types (e.g. contour plot, rug representation),
    + how and why to use the `Viridis` color palettes,
    + creating minimal plots using the Tufte plotting style,
    + how to adjust the plots title, subtitle and caption,
    + how to add different types of lines to a plot,
    + how to change the order in a legend and legend key names,
    + how to add labels to your data (and how to do it in a beautiful way),
    + `shiny` as package for interactive plots.
