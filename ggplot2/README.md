Large parts of this tutorial follow a blog entry called **Beautiful plotting in R: A ggplot2 cheatsheet** by zev@zevross.com, posted on 4. August 2014. You can find the blog entry [here](http://zevross.com/blog/2014/08/04/beautiful-plotting-in-r-a-ggplot2-cheatsheet-3/).

Major changes were made:
* to follow the R style guide (http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html),
* to change style and aesthetics of plots (e.g. axis titles, legends and nice colors),
* to modify data import and setup to RDS,
* to have an executable R script for exercises and workshops,
* to include additional tipps on e.g:
   + how and why to use the `Viridis` color palettes,
   + how to adjust the plot title,
   + how to change the order in a legend and legend key names,
   + `shiny` as package for interactive plots.
